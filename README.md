Task 1 :- Boston Housing Price Predictor
â€¢	This project is a basic machine learning model to predict house prices in the Boston area.
â€¢	The prediction is based on key features like location (TAX), size (number of rooms), and age of the house.
â€¢	The dataset used is the Boston Housing Dataset, which includes various attributes of houses and their prices.
â€¢	We used Linear Regression to train the model on cleaned and scaled data.
â€¢	The data was cleaned by removing duplicates, missing values, and top 1% outliers from the crime rate column.
â€¢	Users can enter 6 inputs: average number of rooms, house age, property tax (as %), highway access index (RAD), distance to employment centers (in km), and crime rate.
â€¢	The model then predicts and displays the estimated house price in Indian Rupees (â‚¹).
â€¢	A scatter plot is also shown to compare the actual vs predicted prices for evaluation.
â€¢	This project was developed as part of an internship assignment to demonstrate practical knowledge of machine learning.

Project - 1 :-  Housing Price Predictor



•	This project is a basic machine learning model to predict house prices in the Boston area.
•	The prediction is based on key features like location (TAX), size (number of rooms), and age of the house.
•	The dataset used is the Boston Housing Dataset, which includes various attributes of houses and their prices.
•	We used Linear Regression to train the model on cleaned and scaled data.
•	The data was cleaned by removing duplicates, missing values, and top 1% outliers from the crime rate column.
•	Users can enter 6 inputs: average number of rooms, house age, property tax (as %), highway access index (RAD), distance to employment centers (in km), and crime rate.
•	The model then predicts and displays the estimated house price in Indian Rupees (₹).
•	A scatter plot is also shown to compare the actual vs predicted prices for evaluation.
•	This project was developed as part of an internship assignment to demonstrate practical knowledge of machine learning.
